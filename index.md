## **Work Experience**

### **X2Analytics - Backend Developer Intern**
+ Secured the Django app running behind a Https Nginx proxy with Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.
+ Built Rest APIs with Django framework to respond front-end requests such as competitor data analysis and potential market analysis.
+ Harden the security by leveraging python-dotenv to hide environment variables or confidential settings.

### **China UnionPay - Software Engineer**
**Microservices Architecture in Golang**
+ Led a team of 4 to build Service Discovery based on Consul KV store, built heartbeat mechanism to watch the status of services.
+ Integrated OpenTracing API to trace requests transiting through services, Collected span context through Kafka for visualization.
+ Developed a lightweight, high-performance and fully-featured gateway based on Gin, supporting 6 million TPS, load balance, protocol conversion and authentication.
+ Designed circuit breaker, leveraging sliding-window rate limiter to smooth burst requests.

### **Huatai Securities - Data Scientist Intern**
**Construction of long-short portfolios**
+ Collected, unified, and stored structured real-time tick data into MongoDB, using python for further analysis.
+ Preprocessed data with Elasticsearch, Pandas, SciPy, analyzed data statistically with statsmodels.
+ Reduced data dimensions by t-SNE and PCA for correlation analysis and visualization.

## **Projects**

### **AI play – Pacman**
+ Implemented DFS, BFS, UCS, A* search algorithm, making the agent find paths efficiently and accurately.
+ Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as design evaluation functions.
+ Worked with MDPs, changed noise and discount parameters to enact different policies. Built epsilon-greedy Q-learning agent, as well as used reinforcement learning to approximate Q-values.

### **Operating System**
+ Made own shell through leveraging syscall, supporting piped, asynchronous, redirect files and internal commands.
+ Created a Unix-like file system in user space, plugged into kernel, heavily using FUSE library and VFS.
+ Designed concurrent KV store grounded on hash with full features of high concurrency, changing in-place and dataset dumping.

### **Replicated State Machine Protocol – Raft in Go**
+ Reconstructed Raft in go, maintaining consistency between replicas by organizing replica’s logs via RPC. 
+ Completed leader election mechanism to ensure single leader, used heartbeat and random time-out to re-elect after failure, designed log entry’s term and index to detect and recovery from failure.
